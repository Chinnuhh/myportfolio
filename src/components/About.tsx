              I'm a versatile digital marketing strategist and brand designer with a unique background that bridges 
              technical infrastructure management and creative marketing excellence.

            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              My journey began in enterprise software engineering at DXC Technology, where I managed infrastructure 
              operations across 8 global data centers and administered over 10,000 servers. This technical foundation 
              gave me a deep understanding of systems, processes, and scalable solutions.

            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              Driven by passion for creativity and human-centered design, I transitioned into digital marketing and 
              founded <strong>Pixelique Designs</strong> â€“ a creative web studio where I've helped 20+ early-stage 
              businesses build complete digital presences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              I specialize in integrating brand psychology, automation tools, and design thinking into scalable 
              growth systems. My approach is always <strong>human-first</strong>, focusing on storytelling and 
              authentic connections that drive real business results.
